## MindMap for Design Data-Intensive Applications

- includes **MindNode** source files (editable)
- includes generate **PDF** (read only)
- includes summary of each chapter in **markdown**

### Chapter One: Reliability, Scalability and Maintainability
> Many applications today are **data-intensive** rather than **compute-intensive**


- Reliability: system works **correctly** even some **faults** happen (hide certain types of **faults** from the **end user**) 
- Scalability: system **performance** is kept good even **load** is **increasing**
- Maintainability: system is easy to **operate**, **understand** and **change**.
